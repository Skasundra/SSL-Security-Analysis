# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The SSL Security Analysis Dashboard is a modern, responsive web application that serves as a comprehensive frontend interface for the existing SSL Security Analysis API. The application will provide an intuitive user experience for analyzing SSL/TLS security, certificate transparency data, and vulnerability assessment. The dashboard will transform complex SSL analysis data into actionable insights through interactive visualizations, real-time monitoring capabilities, and professional reporting features.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters a valid domain name THEN the system SHALL validate the domain format and display appropriate error messages for invalid formats
2. WHEN a user submits a domain for analysis THEN the system SHALL call the backend API endpoint `/analyze/:domain` and display loading states during processing
3. WHEN the analysis completes successfully THEN the system SHALL display comprehensive security results including SSL grade, certificate status, and vulnerability information
4. WHEN the analysis fails or times out THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages with retry options
5. WHEN a user views analysis results THEN the system SHALL present data in organized sections with clear visual hierarchy

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a domain administrator, I want to see a clear security grade and certificate status at a glance, so that I can immediately understand the security health of my domain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analysis results are displayed THEN the system SHALL show a prominent security grade (A+, A, B, C, D, F) with color-coded visual indicators
2. WHEN displaying the security grade THEN the system SHALL use green for A+/A grades, yellow for B/C grades, and red for D/F grades
3. WHEN showing certificate information THEN the system SHALL display certificate validity status, expiration date, and days until expiration
4. WHEN a certificate is expiring soon (within 30 days) THEN the system SHALL highlight this with warning colors and messaging
5. WHEN multiple endpoints exist THEN the system SHALL display the best overall grade while showing individual endpoint grades

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a security analyst, I want to view detailed vulnerability information and security recommendations, so that I can prioritize remediation efforts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN vulnerabilities are detected THEN the system SHALL display a count of issues categorized by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
2. WHEN showing vulnerability details THEN the system SHALL list the top 3 most critical issues with clear descriptions
3. WHEN security recommendations are available THEN the system SHALL display actionable improvement suggestions
4. WHEN vulnerability data is present THEN the system SHALL provide a "View All" option to see comprehensive vulnerability details
5. WHEN no vulnerabilities are found THEN the system SHALL display a positive confirmation message

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a certificate manager, I want to explore certificate transparency data and discover subdomains, so that I can maintain visibility over all certificates issued for my domain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN certificate transparency data is available THEN the system SHALL display total certificates found, active vs expired counts, and certificate timeline
2. WHEN showing subdomain information THEN the system SHALL list discovered subdomains with their security status
3. WHEN displaying certificate history THEN the system SHALL show certificate issuance timeline with monthly counts
4. WHEN certificate data includes issuer information THEN the system SHALL display issuer distribution with visual charts
5. WHEN users want to export data THEN the system SHALL provide options to download certificate details as JSON or CSV

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user on different devices, I want the dashboard to work seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices, so that I can perform SSL analysis from any device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the dashboard on desktop (1024px+) THEN the system SHALL display a full 3-column layout with detailed charts and tables
2. WHEN accessing on tablet (768px-1023px) THEN the system SHALL adapt to a 2-column layout with collapsible sections
3. WHEN accessing on mobile (320px-767px) THEN the system SHALL use a single column layout with touch-friendly interface elements
4. WHEN interacting on touch devices THEN the system SHALL provide swipeable tabs and bottom sheet modals for detailed views
5. WHEN buttons are displayed on mobile THEN the system SHALL ensure minimum 44px touch targets for accessibility

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want the dashboard to be fully accessible, so that I can use screen readers and keyboard navigation effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN navigating the interface THEN the system SHALL support full keyboard navigation for all interactive elements
2. WHEN using screen readers THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate ARIA labels and semantic HTML structure
3. WHEN viewing content THEN the system SHALL maintain WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for color contrast and text sizing
4. WHEN focus moves between elements THEN the system SHALL display clear focus indicators
5. WHEN high contrast mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL adapt colors appropriately for better visibility

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a frequent user, I want to track analysis history and monitor multiple domains, so that I can maintain ongoing security oversight.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing domain analysis THEN the system SHALL store recent searches in browser local storage
2. WHEN accessing the search interface THEN the system SHALL display recent searches as quick-access options
3. WHEN viewing analysis results THEN the system SHALL provide options to bookmark frequently analyzed domains
4. WHEN managing multiple domains THEN the system SHALL allow users to set up monitoring alerts for certificate expiration
5. WHEN historical data is available THEN the system SHALL show security improvements or degradations over time

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a security team member, I want to export and share analysis results, so that I can create reports and communicate findings to stakeholders.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL provide options to export results as PDF reports
2. WHEN sharing results THEN the system SHALL generate unique URLs for sharing analysis data
3. WHEN copying information THEN the system SHALL allow users to copy security summaries to clipboard
4. WHEN exporting detailed data THEN the system SHALL support downloading certificate details as structured data formats
5. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL include executive summaries suitable for non-technical stakeholders

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a performance-conscious user, I want the dashboard to load quickly and respond smoothly, so that I can efficiently perform multiple analyses.
